Please read this before download. This is a vhs workprint of tom savini\\'s 1990 remake. It\\'s reputedly director Tom Savini\\'s personal workprint from point of production, that was stolen from his house. It was recently transfered to dvd and found its way into my hands. The workprint is rough, old and damaged. It\\'s a vhs tape thats at least 21 yo by now. It has no proper title or end credits, only music. No counters. Rough edits. Different, trippy music. Prolonged gore scenes. Its from a point before final editing and censorship so its fully uncut. I\\'ve made a seriouse attempt at restoring this workprint. Av ran several specialised filters to reduce the overall mess and repair it, where possible. Although its much nicer and cleaner than the origional, this is still rough and messy. If you want dvd quality, you aint getting it from this. Remeber, this is rough. The origional transfer was much worse. But it is still very watchable and worth a look. I tried to encode from source several times but out them all, this was the best looking encoding run. Its not perfect but its much improved over source. Take it or leave it. Work done: Video: Ran several filters to reduce scratches, blotches, static lines, aliasing, ringing and damage/age etc. Had to deinterlace but the whole structure was damaged meaning it wouldnt deinterlace properly in areas. I used an additional single field deinterlacer to tidy up the mess but theres still small interlaced artifacts specled here and there. Sharpned the vid on this and defined edges more. Stabalised, filtered out static and adjusted chroma. Then adjusted colours, contrast, brightness and saturation. Tried to remove that nicoten stain coloured film over it all and restore the colours back. Audio: Filtered out tape hiss, reoccuring pops and clicks. Rebalenced and tidied it all up real nice. Overall: Origional encode was 700mb. I trimmed off some dead areas at the start and end and also trimmed some of the messier areas out, just small edits of a few frames done to tidy up the overall vid. Nothing important is lost. This totaled aprox 15mb of edits. Btw, due to the level of scripting invloved, couldnt do this before encoding. Couldnt precision seek in vdub wiout lockups. Had to settle for trimming after encode. http://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1315705460.jpg http://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1315522203.jpg http://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1315705549.jpg http://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1315705600.jpg all thanks to Digideath","downloads":9617,"language":"eng","subject":"Night Of The Living Dead 1990 WORKPRINT","title":"Night Of The Living Dead 1990 WORKPRINT"},{"description":"The classic original but with the editing mistakes and jump cuts fixed.

It was the first feature-length film directed by George A. Romero. Due to an technical error, Night of the Living Dead entered the public domain upon release. The film's music consisted of 50's stock music taken from 'Capitol Hi-Q' sound library. List of alterations to the original 'Night of The Living Dead' film: \u00a0- Original (stock) music has been replaced by analogically generated dark ambient soundscapes and drones (except for the iconic music in the opening credits and end titles). \u00a0- Almost every sound effect has been replaced, altered or enhanced to create a new sonic experience. In stereo. Over a thousand new sounds (mostly self-recorded/designed). Subwoofer is recommended. \u00a0- The picture has been completely re-graded / de-graded. Ai-upscaling has been used. \u00a0- Various editing mistakes have been fixed, e.g. when it\u2019s supposed to be night time Dwayne opens an outside door; you can clearly see daylight coming in through the door for a few seconds. Those frames have been simply cut out. In a few scenes, during the evening, bright day light is clearly coming in through the window (which is fixed by darkening the windows). Etc. Probably most viewers haven\u2019t ever even noticed these slight errors. - In a few fight scenes, where Dwayne hits zombies so painfully slow that he looks as slow as a zombie, the action has been speeded up. Then again, the zombie who attacks Barbara while she is in a car, moves way too fast compared to all other zombies in the Night of the Living Dead. The moving rate of that zombie has been partially reduced. Then the car rolling down the hill is sped up... Again, these are very slight changes. \u00a0- Three scenes have been trimmed: \u00a0- The \u201clove talk\u201d scene between Tom & Judy is slightly less long \u00a0- The beginning of the very-repetitive TV-interview about the mysterious radiation is cut \u00a0- The piece of dialog where Dwayne says that \"those things make no sound\" is cut \u00a0- Some tiny bits and pieces have been re-arranged","downloads":941,"language":"eng","subject":["sound design","horror","public domain","4k","zombie","fanedit"],"title":"Night of the Living Dead (1968) - The Flesh Harvest 4k re-sound design (2024)"},{"date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Un grupo irregular de residentes de Pensilvania se atrinchera en una antigua granja para mantenerse a salvo de una raza de monstruos sedientos de sangre y carne que est\u00e1n devastando la costa este de los Estados Unidos.","downloads":817,"language":"spa","subject":["Zombies","Night of the Living Dead","Terror"],"title":"Night Of The Living Dead ( 1968) Doblada Al Espa\u00f1ol FULL HD"},{"description":"Of Human Bondage is a 1968 black and white movie film which has been colorised, upscaled to 4K, and frames per second boosted to 60 FPS in 2021 using Artificial Intelligence (A.I) and Google Colab @ \u00a0 https://colab.research.google.com/ \u00a0 Technologies used: A.I.
